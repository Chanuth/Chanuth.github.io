            <p>Hey, I'm Chanuth Wijesekara from Galle, Sri Lanka. I graduated in computer science from IIT in 2019 and recently completed my studies at the University of Westminster. During university, I interned at Vizuamatix as a full-stack developer, where I used Java, Python, and machine learning. I also learned Springboot and Vue.js on the job. Now, I'm a trainee at Mercantile, exploring the world of tea brokerage.

                <br><br>In my free time, I love watching movies, playing cricket, and diving into video games. I'm a quick learner and a team player. I'm working on expanding my knowledge of new technologies, but sometimes I get too caught up in details. I'm excited about my career journey, always eager to learn and grow. Thanks for getting to know a bit about me!</p>
